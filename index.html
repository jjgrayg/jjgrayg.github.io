            <h1>JAROD <br> GRAYGO</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my website! I'm Jarod Graygo, a student at Kent State University
                pursuing a BS in Computer Science. This is the place where I will showcase my portfolio
                of current and past projects along with some stuff I generally find interesting. What are
                you waiting for? Take a look around! THIS IS A TEST TO SEE HOW QUICKLY GITHUB PAGES UPDATES SITE ON COMMIT AND PUSH</p>

                <p>This website! This website is a clear work in progress. Some stuff
                    doesn't work, some stuff is incomplete, some needs a bit more interactivity,
                    and there is some obvious work needed on styling, but it is coming along just fine
                    in my opinion.
