                <p>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;This is my first post on my first website so let me begin with a little introduction. My name is Jarod Graygo. I am a computer science student at Kent State University in Kent, OH entering my Junior year. Allow me to take you
                    on my experience building my first website. <br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;It all started about a week ago when I decided that learning web-development languages would be something beneficial to me all around. I decided to reactivate my CodeCademy subscription and take a look at what sort
                    of classes they offer for website design and implementation. I found they had a Skill Path exactly for that called "Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and Github Pages" (mind you this is not an advertisement for the service, just the path I took).
                    I got about halfway through the course before I decided to try to make my own website. I felt I had enough of a loose grasp on the languages HTML and CSS to try to build my own, personal, website and take note of the challenges I faced 
                    along the way. <br>
