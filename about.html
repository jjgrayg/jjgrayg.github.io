                <p>As you've probably gleamed from the website thus far, my name is Jarod Graygo and I am
                    a student at Kent State University in Kent, OH currently pursuing my Bachelor of Science
                    degree in Computer Science. Some of the things I'm most interested in are: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Computers (obviously)</li>
                    <li>The wacky parts of physics</li>
                    <li>Music</li>
                    <li>Video games</li>
                    <li>Puzzles</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In reference to coding, though, the language I'm most fluent in is C++, but the
                    first language I ever learned was Java when I was 12, which I only learned so that
                    I could mod Minecraft. I know a decent bit of Python (I've written a couple projects
                    in the language), and I am currently working on learning HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.
                    While I am by no means an expert on any topic I discuss here, I still think taking the
                    time to write something about an interesting topic will allow me to gain a deeper understanding
                    of it. I'll have to do more in-depth research about a topic than a simple glance at the first headline
                    I see. If you catch any errors in anything I write (be it a post or some code that can be better), 
                    send an email to the one listed on my contact page and I'll fix it up, 
                    and learn a bit more at the same time!</p>
